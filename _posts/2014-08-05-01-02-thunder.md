Boy, I can't stop working on this. This morning I thought about a dynamic visualization with tornados. It was a 5 minutes work from the database to a shapefile to CartoDB [visualization](https://xurxosanz.cartodb.com/viz/4ccfd336-1b92-11e4-9aa6-0e230854a1cb/public_map?title=true&description=true&search=false&shareable=true&cartodb_logo=true&layer_selector=false&legends=false&scrollwheel=true&fullscreen=true&sublayer_options=1&sql=&zoom=1&center_lat=-8.754794702435605&center_lon=75.5859375).

That visualization was great but not really awesome. Then I thought I have thunders in the very same way but instead of 350 hits I had more than 11K. That was something. So I set up the same process and had quickly my third visualization: [Storms 2008](https://xurxosanz.cartodb.com/viz/01221a44-1bf5-11e4-8240-0e73339ffa50/public_map?title=true&description=true&search=false&shareable=true&cartodb_logo=true&layer_selector=false&legends=false&scrollwheel=true&fullscreen=true&sublayer_options=1&sql=&zoom=1&center_lat=-4.565473550710278&center_lon=103.35937499999999).

So I added it to the site and as it was something dynamic, I couldn't offer more interactions to the user that just seat and enjoy the clip, so I did two things.

- Add music to the clip, as a very small Youtube video with the powerful [Thunderstruck theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYFdldfYEJk) by AC/DC. It starts automatically when the page is rendered. Yes I know, sites that automatically play music are a PITA but I couldn't resist myself and the pause button is easy to reach.

- Extracted a dataset aggregated by region using a [Natural Earth](naturalearthdata.com) countries data set. That is, I did first an aggregation of the countries by the region field and then (in the same query) I joined it with the thunders set created on for the viz, using a spatial relation for the join and finally grouping the data by month and region.
