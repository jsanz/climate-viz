Well this is my first post on this project. The idea behind the creation of this log is well, register the main steps done over this project. Don't expect a meticulous wording, or many links and careful crafted images. This is more a dump of what's going on so I'll try to keep it simple and direct.

My first step was creating a private repo on bitbucket. I'll open it eventually, but for the first release I'll do it this way. Once created the repo I've cloned [JekyllBootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/) using the [quick start](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/usage/jekyll-quick-start.html) instructions. Then I set up the remote to my bitbucket repo and uploaded the commits and tags.

After that I've added an annotated tag ''cv0.0'' for the first import so I can start working from that commit.

After that I started updating the default site to remove things and set up a blank index page where the visualization will be placed. I've created a log page to list all these entries and well, I'm writing this post.

Now it's time to commit all those changes and direct myself for the data, let's go!
