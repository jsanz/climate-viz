This site is a small project to try to visualize a [dataset](http://aws.amazon.com/datasets/Climate/2759) about weather data. I'll use the most recent and complete year, that's **2008**. The main aim of this project is to experiment on the visualization of a quite big amount of data, trying to express it in a meaninful way.

I'll try to write a post on the [log](/log/) on every step on the project so you can read my advances over this two days or three of work.

Cheers<br/>
